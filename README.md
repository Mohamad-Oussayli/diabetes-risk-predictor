# Diabetes Risk Predictor

## Objective

This project aims to build, optimize, and evaluate a logistic regression model for predictive analysis. The focus is on data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and feature importance analysis to enhance the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **gender**: Gender of the individual.
- **age**: Age of the individual.
- **hypertension**: Presence of hypertension.
- **heart_disease**: Presence of heart disease.
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index.
- **HbA1c_level**: HbA1c level.
- **blood_glucose_level**: Blood glucose level.
- **diabetes**: Target variable indicating diabetes status.

*Note: The dataset used is for educational purposes and may not represent real-world scenarios.*

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Collection, cleaning, and splitting of data.
- **Model Training**: Initial training of the logistic regression model.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Random and grid search for parameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics and performance assessment.
- **Performance Visualization**: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and F1 score plots.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis and visualization of feature importance.

## Conclusion

- **Summary of Results**: Overview of model performance and key findings.
- **Model Robustness**: Assessment of generalization and effectiveness.
- **Insights**: Key insights from feature importance and model evaluation.

*Note: This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the practical application of logistic regression.*
